# You-Tube-Threat-Corpus

This corpus consists of a total of around 30 000 sentences from around 10 000 YouTube comments. Each sentence is manually annotated as either being a threat or not. 

The corpus can be found in the folder 'YouTubeThreatCorpus'. The corpus is described in the papers "THREAT: A Large Annotated Corpus for Threat Detection" (Hammer et al. 2019). 

A previous version of the corpus was thoroughly evaluated in "Threat detection in online discussions" (Wester et al. 2016) and represent a natural benchmark for future research. The version used in Wester et al. (2016) is not publicly available, but can be obtained by contacting the authors. Both articles are included in the folder 'Articles', along with the bib-files for referencing the articles. Please cite both papers in any work using the corpus.

For more information about the data set, and the preprocessing performed on it, we refer to Chapter 3 of the master's thesis "Detecting threats of violence in online discussions" (Wester, 2016), which can be found at https://www.duo.uio.no/handle/10852/51497.

Sincerely,
Hugo Lewi Hammer, Michael Riegler, Lilja Ã˜vrelid and Erik Velldal
